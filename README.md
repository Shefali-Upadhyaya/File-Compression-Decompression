# File Compression Decompression Tool
This project is a simple Clojure-based tool designed to compress and decompress files. It was created as an assignment to demonstrate basic compression techniques using randomly generated algorithms.

## üîç About the Project
- **Language**: Clojure
- **Files**:
  - `menu.clj`: Contains the menu logic and basic error checking.
  - `compress.clj`: Contains the logic for compressing and decompressing files.
- **Namespace**: The compression logic is defined under the `compress` namespace for easy reference. 

## üíª Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:
- Clojure installed in your environment.
- Docker (optional) if you want to use a Docker environment to run the project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- The menu.clj file provides the user with options for compressing or decompressing files.
- The actual compression and decompression logic is implemented in compress.clj.
- Use the command-line interface to run the tool, and provide necessary file paths.
- Run the Application: Use the Clojure command-line interpreter to run the menu.
```bash
clojure menu.clj
```
